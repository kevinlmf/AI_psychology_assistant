While healthy self-esteem is wonderful, I'm curious to explore with you what a balanced view might look like. What specific achievements or qualities make you feel this way?\n\nSometimes when we're feeling extremely high or low, it helps to ground ourselves in specific examples. Could you share some concrete situations where you've felt successful recently?\n\nRemember, we all have both strengths and areas for growth - that's what makes us human.
